<p class="message">
  I'm a research scientist based in [Edmonton](https://goo.gl/maps/XmqeR) (Alberta, Canada). This blog is - well, I'm not sure exactly - probably just a place to post tutorials, projects and other random stuff I think is interesting. If this all seems a bit vague, I'm sure there is a good reason for that...
