WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) is a mesoscale (regional) numerical weather prediction system developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and others (http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/).

[Weather box](https://github.com/piyushnz/weather-box) provides a set of files you can use to provision an installation of WRF 3.6.1 on an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine.
